I learned how to place a timer on a page and have it run commands at certain points. I was also able to practice a lot more coding in general because this took longer than I originally expected and there was a whole lot of text to write. I was unfamiliar with radio types and a few other things so googling a good amount helped a lot with this homework. I was able to replace elements on the page by either hiding them or making them visible with the use of buttons. I'm happy how it turned out even though making the quiz fast food themed was probably a bad idea because now I feel unhealthy from just thinking about so much fast food.
